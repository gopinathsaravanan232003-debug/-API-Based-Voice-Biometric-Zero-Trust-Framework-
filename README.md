# -API-Based-Voice-Biometric-Zero-Trust-Framework-
The API-Based Voice Biometric Zero Trust Framework is a security solution designed to enhance authentication and access control by integrating voice biometrics within a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). The system is built using Python and exposes its functionality via secure REST APIs.

In a Zero Trust model, no user or device is trusted by default, even if already inside the network perimeter. This project enforces continuous verification of users through voiceprint authentication, ensuring that access is granted only after validating both identity and authorization at every request.
